*****************************
General View of Entities
*****************************
I implemented 3 entities given below and their operations in this project.


**Entities:**
 Post - Like - Suggestion

* **Post:** A table created to hold songs shared by users.
* **Like:** A table created to hold liked posts by users.
* **Suggestion:** A table created to hold song suggestions for adding to the website.

Initialization of table
===========================

.. code-block:: python
   
   def create_post_table():
    with dbapi2.connect(dsn) as connection:
        try:
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            statement = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS POST(
            ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            CONTENT VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
            POSTDATE TIMESTAMP,
            USERID INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES USERDATA(ID) ON DELETE CASCADE,
            SONGID INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES SONG(ID) ON DELETE CASCADE,
            LIKECOUNTER INT DEFAULT 0
            )"""
            cursor.execute(statement)
            connection.commit()
            cursor.close()
        except dbapi2.DatabaseError as e:
            connection.rollback()
   
* Post table has following columns as you can see above.
* **ID:**  It is a serial and primary key for this table.
* **CONTENT:** The attribute created to hold the user's idea about own post.
* **POSTDATE:** The attribute created to hold send date of post.
* **USERID:** It is a foreign key. It references id of **USERDATA**. The attribute that holds the post to whom it belongs.
			  I added **ON DELETE CASCADE** so i provided if the user is deleted, posts belong to this user are deleted too.
* **SONGID:** It is a foreign key. It references id of **SONG**. The attribute that holds what song is shared in the post.
			  I added **ON DELETE CASCADE** so i provided if the song is deleted, posts reference this song are deleted too.	


Selection

Selection for Timeline Page
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

        except dbapi2.DatabaseError as e:
             connection.rollback()
             
* This function gets the user id as an argument. This user id shows which user's posts will be selected from the database.
  All posts of this user are selected from the database. Five tables are joined each others by this select query.
  Because the name of the user, name of artist, picture of artist, file path of song, name of song are necessary for timeline.
  Picture of artist is hold by picture table so we joined picture table. Path of song, song name are hold by song table so
  we joined song table. Artist name is hold by artist table so we joined artist table. User name is hold by userdata table 
  so we joined userdata table.  



             
Selection for Update Page
------------------------------	

.. code-block:: python
   
    def select_post(UPDATEID):
	    with dbapi2.connect(dsn) as connection:

	             connection.rollback()

* This function gets the post id as an argument. This post id shows which post will be selected from the database. 
  It returns the post variables to be updated. 


Insertion
==========
.. code-block:: python
   
	def insert_post_page():
	    with dbapi2.connect(dsn) as connection:
	        try:
	            cursor = connection.cursor()
	            content = request.form['content']
	            songid = request.form['songid']
	            userid = current_user.id
	            postdate = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
	            query ="""INSERT INTO POST(CONTENT,USERID,SONGID,POSTDATE) VALUES(%s,%s,%s,%s)"""
	            cursor.execute(query,(content,userid,songid,postdate))
	            connection.commit()
	        except dbapi2.DatabaseError as e:
	            connection.rollback()

* The content,songid which is taken from user thanks to form is assigned to the content and songid of post to be inserted.
  Posting date is taken with "datetime.datetime.now()" when the this function works. Also user id is taken as current user id, because
  only the user who has logged in can send a post. A new row is added to post table by sending these values to the query. 
  
Updation
=========

            connection.commit()
        except dbapi2.DatabaseError as e:
            connection.rollback()

* This function gets the post id as an argument. This post id shows which post will be updated. The new text which is taken from
  user thanks to form is assigned to the content of post to be updated. 
  
Deletion
==========

* **SUGGESTIONDATE:**  The attribute created to hold send date of suggestion.
* **RELEASEDATE:** The attribute created to hold information of when the song was released.
* **STATU:** The attribute created to hold status of suggestion.
			* It is checked whether it is between 1 and 3 or not. Because there are three types status.
			* Two represents Status **Waiting**.
			* One represents Status **Approved**. 
			* Zero represents Status **Denied**.

* This function selects all suggestions in the database for admin perspective. These selected suggestions is used 
  for approval and rejection of pop-up screen in admin perspective. User and suggestion tables are joined each others by this select query. 
  Because name of user is needed too.

Insertion
=============

* This function takes user id, artist, song name and release date as argument. This data is provided from user thanks to 
  form expect user id. User id data is user id of current user. Because only current user can suggest a song. The user 
  must be logged in before the user can suggest a song. This data which is taken from the user is assigned the values of suggestion
  to be inserted and the query is executed. 


Updation
=============

Reject Suggestion

* This function takes suggestion id as argument. This id is id of suggestion to be rejected. This query makes zero the status
  value of desired suggestion. Because zero statu value means "rejected". 
  
  
Approve Suggestion
--------------------

* This function takes suggestion id as argument. This id is id of suggestion to be approved. This query makes one the status
  value of desired suggestion. Because one statu value means "approved".

* This function is routing function of searching user. This function looks for a registered user with the given username
  in the database. If user does not exist, function redirects to timeline page of current user with error message. If user exists, function redirects 
  to timeline of this user. If current user enters own user name, function redirect to timeline page of current user again.    	                                

Like and Dislike a Post
--------------------------

.. code-block:: python 	
   
	@app.route('/timeline/like/<int:LIKEID>/<string:USERNAME>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
	@login_required
	def like_post(LIKEID,USERNAME):
	    if(control_like(current_user.id,LIKEID)):
	        insert_like(current_user.id,LIKEID)
	    else:
	        delete_like(current_user.id,LIKEID)
	
	    if(USERNAME == current_user.username):
	          return redirect(url_for('timeline_page'))
	    else:
	          user = get_user(USERNAME)
	          return render_template("timeline_search.html", 
	          					posts=list(select_posts(user.id)), 
	          					likes = list(select_user_likes(current_user.id)),
	          					owner_user = user,
	          					isfollower = check_follower(current_user.username,user.username).fetchone())

* This function is routing function of like and dislike post operations. When a user clicks a like button, function checks
  this post is liked before by this user. If it is liked before, function deletes this like. If it is not, function insertes 
  like. After that, if liked post belongs to current user, function redirects to timeline page of current user. If it is
  not, function redirects timeline of owner of liked post.


Control Like
-------------------
.. code-block:: python


	def control_like(userId,postId):
	    with dbapi2.connect(dsn) as connection:
	        cursor = connection.cursor()
	        cursor = select_like(userId,postId)
	        control = cursor.fetchone()
	
	        if control is None:
	            return True
	        else:
	            return False
	            
* This function checks whether the given user likes the given post. If the user liked, function returns false. If the user did not
